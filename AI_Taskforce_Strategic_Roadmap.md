1. **AI-Focused Workshops & Certifications**  
   - Offer advanced training for faculty on AI tools relevant to their discipline, from coding assistants to data visualization platforms.  
   - Recognize mastery or micro-credentials, motivating continuous skill development.

2. **Cross-Departmental Course Creation**  
   - Develop electives or required core courses co-led by faculty in complementary fields (e.g., Computer Science + Business).  
   - Initiate pilot “living labs” where new AI-related modules are tested, refined, and eventually scaled.

3. **Continuous Feedback Loops**  
   - Gather student feedback on AI components in courses—what worked, what was unclear, and where more support is needed.  
   - Encourage instructors to share AI teaching success stories, resources, and lesson plans in a central repository or during professional development events.

### 9.5 Implementation Guidance

- **Phased Rollout**: Introduce basic AI usage in lower-level courses, scaling complexity in upper-level classes or capstones.
- **New Courses**: Create curricular courses that can serve as an introduciton or intermediate use of AI.  [example course](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/AI-Curriculum/tree/main/Introduction%20to%20AI)  
- **Incentivize Adoption**: Allocate funding for AI-related lab equipment, student licenses for premium AI tools, and specialized faculty training.  
- **Evaluate Impact**: Collect data on student outcomes, engagement, and course satisfaction to refine AI-based teaching strategies.  

By infusing AI directly into course activities, project work, and overall program outcomes, City Tech ensures graduates are not only **AI-literate** but also **critically aware** of its potential benefits and pitfalls. This holistic approach to **“teaching AI”** complements the broader institutional strategy for AI deployment—equipping the entire campus community with the skills and perspectives needed to thrive in an increasingly technology-driven world.

## Conclusion  
By systematically pursuing each pillar of this strategic roadmap—clear objectives, robust governance, data readiness, comprehensive risk management, cultural transformation, **and curricular integration**—City Tech can fully unlock AI’s potential. Retaining the original high-level use cases ensures continuity with early planning, while the expanded detail on **AI in the curriculum** underscores how AI can be woven into both **learning outcomes** and **productivity tools**. With ongoing evaluation, collaboration, and a commitment to ethical oversight, these AI initiatives will strengthen institutional processes, foster interdisciplinary innovation, and deepen the academic experience for all members of the City Tech community.
